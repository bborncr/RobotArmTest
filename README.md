# Robot Arm Controller using Godot
The idea is to use a 3D representation of a robot arm in Godot as an interface to control and program sequences and animations of an Arduino based robot arm.
## Controls
The idea is to use two markers to control the arm's 3D position. One marker is on the floor and indicates the horizontal distance and angle from the base. The second marker will indicated the vertical axis.

Currently, the mouse and keyboard controls the camera (WASD keys) and the arrow keys control the target of the arm.
